# Lab 1: Introduction to stainless

In this first lab, you will use stainless to verify a short scala file.

## Installation

### Java Development Kit

In order to run stainless, as well as the programs you will verify, you will need **Java 17**.

You can check your Java version using

```shell
> java -version
openjdk version "17.0.8.1" 2023-08-24
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.8.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.8.1+1, mixed mode)
> javac -version
javac 17.0.8.1
```

The exact version might vary, but the major version should be 17.

On some Linux distributions, a command exists to change your "active" JDK if multiple ones are installed on your machine. Examples include:

- **Debian-based:** `update-alternatives -config java`;
- **[ArchLinux-based](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java#Switching_between_JVM):** `archlinux-java set java-17-openjdk`.

### Scala

You will also need a way to compile scala programs.
We will provide files meant to be used with [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/) while working with stainless, but you will also need [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) when working with [LISA](https://github.com/epfl-lara/LISA) in future labs.
As such, we recommend that you install [coursier](https://get-coursier.io/), which will come with the scala compiler, scala-cli and sbt.
Install instructions can be found [here](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation).

You will need to add coursier's `bin` directory to your path. The `bin` directory's path (typically `~/.local/share/coursier/bin` on Linux) will be printed in the terminal near the end of the installation.

You can test your installation with

```shell
> scala -version
Scala code runner version 3.3.1 -- Copyright 2002-2023, LAMP/EPFL
> scala-cli -version
Scala CLI version: 1.0.4
Scala version (default): 3.3.0
> sbt -version
sbt version in this project: 1.9.6
sbt script version: 1.9.6
```

### Stainless

Download the latest stainless release (0.9.8.1) from its [repository](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/releases/tag/v0.9.8.1) (download the file named `stainless-dotty-standalone-0.9.8.1-<your_os>.zip`).
On Windows, it is recommended to run the linux version on top of the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

The release is an archive containing, among other things, a script called **stainless**, that you should make available on your path. Detailed instructions can be found in [this video](https://tube.switch.ch/videos/03edee61).

On Mac, you should also make the `z3` executable (which is part of the stainless release) available on your path.

Stainless should then produce the following output (you may need to add `.sh` or `.bat` after `stainless`)

```shell
> stainless --version
[  Info  ] Stainless verification tool (https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless)
[  Info  ] Version: 0.9.8.1
[  Info  ] Built at: 2023-09-21 16:19:34.140+0200
[  Info  ] Stainless Scala version: 3.2.0
[  Info  ] Bundled Scala compiler: 3.2.0
```

## Tutorial

A basic tutorial on stainless can be found [here](https://epfl-lara.github.io/stainless/tutorial.html). Additionally, some older videos can be found on the [repository](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/#further-documentation-and-learning-materials). In particular, illustrative examples are in the [bolts/tutorials](https://github.com/epfl-lara/bolts/tree/master/tutorials) including those from the [FMCAD 2021 tutorial](https://github.com/epfl-lara/fmcad2021tutorial). The beginning of [ASPLOS 2022 tutorial](https://epfl-lara.github.io/asplos2022tutorial/) may be of interest as well. Some of the [verified examples in Stainless source directory](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/blob/main/frontends/benchmarks/verification/valid/) are interesting, such as [BalancedParentheses.scala](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/blob/main/frontends/benchmarks/verification/valid/BalancedParentheses.scala), [associative list](https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless/blob/main/frontends/benchmarks/verification/valid/AssociativeList.scala).

To have a bit more intuition for how to do induction proofs, consider the following arithmetic example that verifies in Stainless:

```scala
def sumTo(n: BigInt): BigInt =
  require(0 <= n)
  if n == 0 then BigInt(0)
  else n + sumTo(n-1)

def sumToIsCorrect(n: BigInt): Unit = {
  require(0 <= n)
  if n == 0 then ()
  else sumToIsCorrect(n-1)
} ensuring { _ => sumTo(n) == n*(n+1)/2 }
```

Whereas we could have modified `sumTo` to state the postcondition `res == n*(n+1)/2`, here we decided to leave `sumTo` as is. To ensure that Stainless proves property by induction, we repeat the recursive structure of `sumTo` inside the body of `sumToIsCorrect`. The result is the same induction schema as if we added apostcondition to `sumTo`. Simple cases of such induction can be simulated by adding `induct` annotation to the original method, but writing explicitly induction schema as we did here is more general.

## Lab

### Getting the source

To start working on this lab, you can either clone this entire repository, or download the present directory alone from Gitlab (there should be a button for this on the top right of the web interface).

### The `sublist` relation

The file `Sublist.scala` (in this directory) defines a relation `sublist` on lists, also noted $`\sqsubseteq`$, which holds when all the elements of the first list appear in the second in the same order. Some examples:

```math
\newcommand{\slist}[0]{\sqsubseteq}
\newcommand{\seq}[1]{\langle#1\rangle}
\begin{align*}
    \seq{0,2} &\slist \seq{0,1,2} \\
    \seq{0,0,2} &\not\slist \seq{0, 2}\\
    \seq{1,0} &\not\slist \seq{0,0,1} \\
    \seq{10,5,25} &\slist \seq{70,10,11,8,5,25,22}
\end{align*}
```

![sublist example](SublistExample.png)

The file includes a main function which checks the examples above

```shell
> scala-cli run Sublist.scala
<0,2> âŠ‘ <0,1,2> = true
<0,0,2> âŠ‘ <0,2> = false
<1,0> âŠ‘ <0,0,1> = false
<10,5,25> âŠ‘ <70,10,11,8,5,25,22> = true
<25,11,53,38> âŠ‘ <15,25,11,8,53,22,38> = true
```

### Goal of the lab

The `List` data-structure as well as the `sublist` relation are already implemented; your job is now to prove some properties on the latter, such as reflexivity, transitivity, and antisymmetry.
These properties are stated in the form of functions which "do nothing": they return `Unit` and have no effects.
You have to fill these functions with a proof of their statement.

As an example, the first property to prove is reflexivity. It is stated as follows

```scala
def reflexivity[T](l: List[T]): Unit = {
  /* TODO: Prove me */
}.ensuring(_ =>
  sublist(l, l)
)
```

which should be understood mathematically as

```math
\newcommand{\slist}[0]{\sqsubseteq}
\newcommand{\seq}[1]{\langle#1\rangle}
\forall l,\  l \slist l
```

Another example: transitivity

```scala
def transitivity[T](l1: List[T], l2: List[T], l3: List[T]): Unit = {
  require(sublist(l1, l2) && sublist(l2, l3))
  /* TODO: Prove me */
}.ensuring(_ =>
  sublist(l1, l3)
)
```

which should be interpreted as

```math
\newcommand{\slist}[0]{\sqsubseteq}
\newcommand{\seq}[1]{\langle#1\rangle}
\forall l_1\, l_2\, l_3,\ l_1 \slist l_2 \land l_2 \slist l_3 \implies l_1 \slist l_3
```

The file contains eleven properties on `sublist` that you have to prove.

To check your proofs, use

```shell
# On Linux and WSL
> stainless Sublist.scala
# On Mac
> stainless --solvers=smt-z3 Sublist.scala
```

The provided configuration file ([stainless.conf](stainless.conf)) will automatically set the SMT solver's timeout to 2 seconds.
You can override this while experimenting with your proofs by either changing the configuration file or using the command line, by adding e.g. `--timeout=5` to set the timeout to 5 seconds.
You can also add `--watch` for stainless to automatically run on file save:

```shell
> stainless --timeout=5 --watch Sublist.scala
```

You are not allowed to change the definition of `sublist` or the statement (parameters/return types, function name, requirements, conclusion, ...) of any of the properties.
The only exception to this rule is the `@induct` annotation, which you are allowed to add to any parameter.

Some advice:

- Try to understand how you would prove these properties with paper and pencil, and use examples to gain intuition;
- Induction is the main proof method in many cases; see the videos on how to write inductive proofs;
- Prove lemmas in order: earlier lemmas (and their structure) will help you with subsequent lemmas;
- Even though it is not necessary, you can define new lemmas if it helps (but you then have to prove them correct as well ðŸ˜Š);
- Regarding the four lemmas about concatenation: two very similar lemmas can have vastly different proofs (in both size and difficulty â€“ can you tell why ?).

## Submission

Once you've completed all proofs, you can submit your [Sublist.scala](Sublist.scala) file on [Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1092878).

You also need to pick your groups (min 2, max 3) for the labs and projects on [Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1216793).

Only one member of each group should submit a solution.
